# Doric

Doric is a simple Vue.js-based application for wiring together widgets organized into columns.

It is intended to be a workbench for developing new widgets and experimenting with interaction between widgets.

The widgets being developed are primarily focused on viewing and annotating texts but the Doric framework itself makes no assumptions about the kinds of widgets used.

## Project setup

```shell
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```shell
npm run serve
```
